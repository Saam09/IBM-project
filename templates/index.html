                Reddit is a social media platform and online community where registered users can share and discuss
                content. It is one of the largest and most active online communities in the world. Reddit is
                organized into thousands of topic-specific communities called "subreddits." Each subreddit focuses
                on a particular theme or interest, such as news, sports, gaming, technology, movies, music, and many
                more.

                Users can submit posts, which can be text, links, images, videos, or polls, to a specific subreddit.
                Other users can then upvote or downvote these posts based on their relevance and quality. The most
                popular posts rise to the top of the subreddit or even the site-wide "front page," gaining more
                visibility and engagement.

            Financial independence is the status of having enough income or wealth sufficient to pay one's living
            expenses for the rest of one's life without having to be employed or dependent on others. Income earned
            without having to work a job is commonly referred to as passive income. Others define financial
            independence differently according to their own goals
            Reddit is an American social news aggregation, content rating, and discussion website. Registered users
            (commonly referred to as "Redditors") submit content to the site such as links, text posts, images, and
            videos, which are then voted up or down by other members
            Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) is a movement of people devoted to a program of extreme
            savings and investment that aims to allow them to retire far earlier than traditional budgets and
            retirement plans would permit.
